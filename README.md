Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Main Tasks
The basic idea is to make a visual novel type experience, where two characters talk to each other. The
characters change poses and text changes in a dialogue box as the audio track runs.

- [x] Make a page with a simple audio player.
- [x] Add a background image.
- [x] Show the two characters on screen at the same time.
- [x] The audio player must have the following buttons: play/pause.
- [x] The script is synched to the audio: pausing the audio will pause the script.
- [x] Translate the provided script into whatever code format you think is best.
- [x] Hardcode the script in for now, but make it easy to replace it with data from an api.
- [x] You may use the provided files/script or come up with your own.

### Bonus Tasks
#### Make a single character scheme:

- [ ] One character on screen at a time.
- [x] When the same character changes pose, use a fade effect.
- [ ] When a different character appears, use a slide effect.

#### Consider simple animation effects:
- [ ] Blinking: characters randomly blink over time.
- [ ] Mouth movement: animate charactersâ€™ mouths when they are talking.
- [x] Effects on top of characters: like sweat drops, angry... 


#### Consider text effects:
- [ ] Text animations: make a single word shake.
- [x] Text colors/fonts: make a single word have a different color and font.

#### Audio player:
Add additional controls to the audio player. The slider should be in sync with the audio.
- [x] slider, 
- [x] restart button, 
- [x] skip forward by 10 seconds. 
- [x] skip backwards by 10 seconds.
